        <div class="title"> "Who do you want to be in the future?" </div> <br>
        <div class="indent ubuntu-grande bottom"> 
            That's such a difficult question for me. As an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/istp-personality" class="links" target="_blank"> istp person</a>, 
            there's no clear answer. I know I want to get a degree in Computer Science. But I also know I want to try so many different things like studying culinary arts or learn dancing. 
            It's very uncentain to say what I'll be doing. Plus, I don't really care. I love enjoying the present. I know I'll have to worry about 
            the future, but just when time comes. However, I do have some clear things now. I want more kids and highschoolers in Peru to get the chance to learn 
            programming. Schools in Peru only teach us how to use Word, PowerPoint and Excel. And it's literally just "using" because we never get to 
            the part of learning commands in Excel. I know this is a different reality from many other countries. That's why I want to give middle/highschooler 
            an alternative education opportunity. To make programming more accesible, I'll be adding competitive programming resources :). 
            
            <br> <br> 
            Some questions no one asked: 
            <ul class="unordered-list"> 
                <li class="bullet"> "Do you really believe in the mbti test? Isn't it just a fake test like all the others?" 
                    <ul class="bullet"> Yeah, mostly. When my bestie @sofia introduced me to this test my first thought was: this is bullshit, it's like every other test that
                    asks for your favorite color and tell you <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/mathewguiver/which-type-of-bread-are-you" class="links" target="_blank">
                    which type of bread you are</a>
                    or <a href="https://www.proprofs.com/quiz-school/story.php?title=what-anime-girl-are-you" class="links" target="_blank"> 
                    what anime girl you are</a>. Once I took the test and read the personality type I got, I felt like I was being spied on. </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li class="bullet"> "Should I 100% rely on the test?" 
                    <ul class="bullet"> Of course not. These personalities are just "models", it considers that people are either introverted or extroverted. And of course, there also 
                    exist ambiverts and another personalities like "chameleon" that addapt themselves to each group they're interacting with. So, if you get a 
                    result and are like "nah, that's not me", that's completely fine. 
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="bullet"> "If you want to make programming accesible to peruvian kids, why is your website in English?" 
                    <ul class="bullet"> For some reason, I find it easier to write in English. The words flow easily in my mind.
                    It's really weird because Spanish is my native language. It just happens that I've written lots of essays in English and none in Spanish.
                    BUT, I'll definitely be making this website in Spanish too. I just need to learn to learn how to make a scrollball to select the language. 
                    No problem. I'll do it.  </ul>
                </li>

                <li class="bullet"> "Where does 
                    <span class="cursive"> pyedb48 </span> come from?" 
                    <ul class="bullet"> It's an acronym I created with a friend many years ago. "Pierina y el dios Barrantes". The "48"
                    comes from the number <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythology_of_Lost#The_Numbers" rel="lost-link" class="links" target="_blank"> 
                    4815162342</a>. You gotta watch lost omg. <br> 
                    Fun fact: I used this
                    weird thing as my username in codeforces because at first I thought I would'nt like programming that much and using a stupid handle
                    would not affect me xD. 
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li class="bullet"> "Cats or Dogs?" 
                    <ul class="bullet"> Dogs 100%!!!! They're really cute and can understand us. Cats are... cats, too cold for me.  </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="bullet"> "Why are you making this website?, it's so basic"
                    <ul class="bullet"> I don't care. I'm learning :) </ul>
                </li>
